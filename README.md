# Orblockade

Orblockade is a simple 3D game inspired by the classic arcade game **Blockade**, reimagined on a spherical surface instead of a flat plane. The project is written in **C & C++**, utilizing **SDL3** and **Dawn (WebGPU)** for low-level, cross-platform graphics.

## Project Goals

- Recreate the core mechanics of Blockade in a 3D spherical environment
- Learn and demonstrate proficiency with modern graphics APIs (SDL3, Dawn)
- Build a portfolio-quality project for a software developer career transition

## Current Status

- **Initial commit:**  
    - Sets up the project structure  
    - Opens a window and draws a single-color texture  
    - Integrates SDL3 and Dawn libraries  
    - Tested on Windows with MSVC build tools

## Planned Features

- 3D spherical movement and collision logic
- Multiplayer support
- Cross-platform builds (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Enhanced graphics and effects

## Build & Run

> **Note:** Currently tested only on Windows with MSVC.

1. Clone the repository
2. Create the "external" directory and install dependencies there: SDL3, Dawn (WebGPU)
3. Build using your preferred C/C++ build system (e.g., CMake, MSVC)
4. Run the executable
